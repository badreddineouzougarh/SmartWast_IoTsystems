
## Project Overview

Waste collection is a critical phase of waste management, directly influencing the overall efficiency of the system. The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) into collection processes offers significant advantages by enabling real-time monitoring of container fill levels, optimizing collection routes, and reducing operational costs. IoT thus provides a valuable technological solution to help companies enhance their efficiency in waste collection.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to:

- **Create an effectively safe and hygienic environment** by amalgamating technology with waste management.
- **Optimize resource allocation, reduce operating costs**, and increase the sustainability of waste services based on IoT technology.
- **Enable more efficient route planning** for waste collectors and reduce the likelihood of a bin being full for more than a week.
- **Ensure a good level of coordination** between waste collectors and information provided via technology, making them aware of the existing waste level and prompting intervention whenever bins reach critical threshold levels.
- **Identify specific container filling patterns** through historical data and manage them accordingly in the long term.
- **Provide alert messages to waste collectors** so they can collect waste on time without cluttering the surroundings.

## Existing Problem

Waste management has become an alarming challenge in cities and villages worldwide. Often, local bins overflow, and municipalities are unaware of it. This affects residents in various ways, from foul odors to unhealthy and hazardous surroundings. Poor waste management - ranging from the absence of collection systems to inefficient disposal - leads to air pollution, water, and soil contamination. 

To address this issue, **IoT (Internet of Things)** technology comes into play by providing intelligent management of these bins while facilitating their collection by the responsible waste management company.

## Solution Description

Within the framework of this project, we are developing an IoT-based solution to streamline waste management and assist the waste collection company. This solution involves:

- Planning **optimal routes** to access trash bins.
- Designing a **mobile application** for real-time monitoring of bin fill levels to empty those that are full.
- Developing a **deep learning model** capable of predicting the fill level of the bins within a given time frame.

Our solution aims to be effective in:

- **Preserving the cleanliness** of the environment.
- Helping the **waste collection company** by optimizing their operations.

## Technologies Used

- **IoT (Internet of Things) with the Sensorthing APi **  : An OGC standard for sensor and localisation services for a real-time monitoring and data collection.
- **Mobile App Development** using React and NodeJS for monitoring and communication with waste collectors.
- **Deep Learning model ** for predicting bin fill levels and optimizing collection schedules.
- **Route Optimization Algorithms with LeafletJs** for improving waste collection routes.
